--- abstract

This document details the mechanism used for initial enrollment
using a smartphone of a BRSKI Registrar system.

There are two key differences in assumption from
{{I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra}}: that the intended registrar has
Internet, and that the Pledge has no user-interface.

This variation on BRSKI is intended to be used in the situation where the
registrar device is new out of the box and is the intended gateway to the
Internet (such as a home gateway), but has not yet been configured.  This
work is also intended as a transition to the Wi-Fi Alliance work on the
Device Provisioning Protocol (DPP).

# Introduction

The problem of bootstrapping a new device is described at length in
{{I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra}} (aka BRSKI).  The problem that BRSKI
solves is the case of a smart, properly configured network with a minimum of
network connectivity (or previously pre-previoned with nonceless vouchers),
and a relatively stupid new device (the Pledge), which lacks a user
interface.

The BRSKI problem is one of trust: how does the new device trust that it has
found the correct network to join, and how does the new network become
convinced that the new device is a device that is intended to join.
BRSKI solves the problem well for the case where the network is well
connected and can easily talk to the device's Manufacturer Authorized Signing
Authority (MASA), while providing appropriate proxy mechanisms to enable the
new pledge to communicate it's proximity assertion to the MASA as well.

This document is about a variation of the problem: when the new device being
introduce has no network connectivity, but a new device is intended to
serve as the Registrar for the network. This new device is likely a home (or
small office) gateway, and until it is properly configured there will be
no direct network connectivity.

There are a number of protocols that permit an ISP to consider a new router
brought into a home to be a new pledge to the ISPs' network, and for that new
device to integrated into the ISP's (autonomic) network. BRSKI can be used
itself, and there are ways to use the Broadband Form's TR-069 to bootstrap
the device in this way.  This document is not about the situation where
the router device is intended to belong to the ISP, but about the situation
where the home user intends to own and control the device.

## Intermittent Device connectivity {#disconnected}

There is an additional variation which this variation solves: the case where
there is one or more devices in a place with no immediate connectivity to a
Registrar.   An example of this could be a new home construction where a
furnace, thermostat or other control systems need to be introduced to each
other.  If a registrar exists it will have no Internet connectivity (as
above), until the home becomes owned by the first owner.  There might never
be a registrar though.

The basement case is important because the assumption is that the *installer*
may have poor or no LTE connectivity in that location.  The installer will
have to exit the basement, perhaps even return to their truck, in order to
have network connectivity for their provisioning device (a smartphone
equivalent).

## Additional Motivation

The Wi-Fi Alliance has released the Device Provisioning Protocol {{dpp}}.
The specification is available only via "free" registation.
The specification relies on being able to send and receive 802.11 Public
Action frames, as well as Generic Advertisement Service (GAS) Public Action
frames.  Access to send new layer-2 frames is generally restricted in most
smartphone operating systems (iOS, Android). At present there are no known
public APIs that a generic application writer could use, and therefore the
smart-phone side of the DPP can only be implemented at present by the vendors
of those operating systems.

As both dominant vendors have competing proprietary mechanisms, it is unclear
if generic applications will be produced soon.  It is probably impractical
for a vendor an a smart-appliance to independantly produce an application
that can do proper DPP in 2019.  As one of the common goals of this document
and DPP is that there need not be an application-per-device only one DPP
application need exist.  Until such time as such an application becomes
universal it is a goal of this document to lay the groundwork for a
transition to full use of DPP by leveraging the QR code infrastructure
that DPP depends upon.

In addition to the above concern, DPP is primary concerned about provisioning
WiFi credentials to devices.  DPP can provision access points themselves, but
it lacks any kind of manufacturer integration.  BRSKI provides this
integration, and therefore an audit trail history for the device.

The smarkaklink enrollment process described in this document is about
securely initializing the administrative connection with a device that is the
WiFi Access Point.

# Terminology          {#Terminology}

The following terminology is copied from {{I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra}}

enrollment: The process where a device presents key material to a network and
acquires a network specific identity. For example when a certificate signing
request is presented to a certification authority and a certificate is
obtained in response.

pledge:
: The prospective device, which has an identity installed at the factory.

IDevID:
: a manufacturer signed keypair (different from the QRkey) which is generated
at the factory. This is the 802.1AR artifact which is mandated by
{{I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra}}.

The following new terminology has been added

smarkaphone:
: The prospective administrator device, usually a smartphone equipped with a
QR capable camera, wifi and 3G connectivity.

adolescent router (AR):
: a home router or device containing a registrar. The device does not yet
have network connectivity, and has no administrator.  It is considered not a
"baby" device in the same way that the pledge is, but it is not yet an adult.
A better term would be welcome.

SelfDevID:
: a public/private key pair generated by the smartpledge, formed into a
self-signed PKIX certificate.  The private key part remains always on the
smartpledge, but like other secondary device keys, should be encrypted for
backup
purposes. {EDNOTE: any references to Apple or Android APIs/specifications here?}

QRkey:
: a unique, raw ECDSA or EdDSA key pair generated in (or for) the adolescent router
at the factory, and stored in the configuration portion of the firmware.  The
public portion is printed in a QRcode.  This key is not formed into a
certificate of any kind.

smarkaklink: the name of this protocol.

adolescent router (AR): a home router or device containing a registrar. The
device does not yet have network connectivity, and has no administrator.

## History and Origin of the name

This document was originally called the "smartpledge" variation of BRSKI.
This name was intended to indicate that the variation is one where the
BRSKI role of Pledge is taken on by the smartphone device.

While the end-goal is to have the smartphone enrolled into a PKI hosted
by the fully-grown Router, the activities of each device do not map
into the BRSKI roles at the beginning.  In fact, they are reversed
with the Adolescent Router being the Pledge.  Review of this document
suggested that removing the word pledge would help.

The new name "smarkaklink" is intended to sound like the sound that
two (wine, beer) glasses make after a toast is made.

# Requirements Language {#rfc2119}

In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
"SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, RFC 2119
{{RFC2119}} and indicate requirement levels for compliant STuPiD
implementations.

# Assumptions and Required Setup

The first assumption is that intended device owner is active and is
present. The device owner has a smart-phone that is capable of using Wi-Fi or
being wired into the adolescent router (AR).

The smartpledge application generates a self-signed certificate with
public/private keypair that it knows.  It may generate a unique certificate
for each manufacturer.  This certificate is called the SelfDevID.

The second assumption is that the device has a QR code printed on the outside
of the unit, and/or provided with the packaging/documentation.  The QR code
is as specified in section 5.3 of {{dpp}}, with the additions specified in {{qrextra}}

The third assumption is that the AR, at manufacturing time, has the anchor
for it's MASA (same assumption as for BRSKI pledge's).  In addition, like
the BRSKI pledge, the AR has an IDevID certificate (and associated private
key) signed by the manufacturer.

The fourth assumption is that the key in the "K:" attribute {{qrextra}} is a
different public key pair.  It MUST be different from the key used in the
IDevID.  This key is called the DPP-Keypair.

# Protocol Overview

This is the overview of the process.
{EDNOTE: there are many details here that belong in the next section.
The goal in this section is to consisely explain the interaction among the
components. Clearly this text currently fails in that regard}

## Scan the QR code

The operator of the smartphone invokes the smarkaklink application, and scans
the QR code on the AR.  The smartphone learns the ESSID, Public-Key,
mac-address, smarkaklink URL, and link-local address of the AR.

## Enroll with the manufacturer

The smartphone uses it's 3G, or other WiFi internet access to connect to the
manufacturer with TLS.  The manufacturer is identified with the smartpledge
URL.

The operator of the smartphone may need to move to another location to get
connectivity.  It is desireable that an operator be able to scan many QR
codes before moving, performing this operation in a batch.  There may
be multiple devices from the same manufacturer, and the smarkalink
application SHOUld enroll with the manufacturer a single time for all
devices.

The smartphone does an HTTP POST to the provided URL using it's generated
certificate as it's ClientCertificate.
As described in {{smartpledgeenroll}}, the manufacturer MAY respond with a
302 result code, and have the end user go through a web browser based process
to enroll.  After that process, a redirection will occur using OAUTH2.

The result should finally be a 201 result code, and at that URL is a new
certificate signed by the manufacturer.

## Connect to BRSKI join network

The application then reconnects the Wi-Fi interface of the smartphone to the
ESSID of the AR.   This involves normal 802.11 station attachment.  The
given ESSID explicitely has no WPA or other security required on it.

There will be no DHCPv4 on this network.  This simplifies the operation
of the devices that are enrolling, but it also makes the network
uninteresting to other random users that may stumble upon the open ESSID.

A IPv6 Router Solicitation may elicit an answer (confirming the device is
there), but it is acceptable for there to be no prefix information.  An IPv6
Neighbour Discovery is done for the IPv6 Link-Local address of the AR.
Receipt of an answer confirms that the ESSID is correct and present.

(XXX -- not using GRASP here. Could use GRASP, but QR code is better)

## Connect to Adolescent Registrar (AR)

The smarkaklink application then makes a direct (no proxy) TLS connection to
port 8443 (!XXX!) of the AR, on the IPv6 Link-Local address given.  This is
as in section 5.1 of {{I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra}}.   The
smartphone uses it's SelfDevID as the TLS ClientCertificate, as the
smartphone and smarkaklink will not have a manufacturer signed IDevID.

Additionally, the AR will use it's IDevID certificate as the
ServerCertificate of the TLS conncetion.  As with other BRSKI IDevID,
it will have a MASA URL extension, as described in
{{I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra}} section 2.3.2.

The Adolescent Registrar acts in the role of pledge!

## Pledge Requests Voucher-Request from the Adolescent Registrar

The smartphone generates a random nonce _SPnonce_.
(Do we need something time-based too here?)

The smarkaklink client encrypts this to the public key of the
AR, which was found in the QR code.  If the key is RSA, this is a
simple public key operation (we need to reference appropriate padding due to
various attacks).  In the mandatory to implement ECDSA case, then ECIES is
used instead.

The result goes into the Voucher-Request-Request, posted as a JSON
containing a single field: *voucher-request challenge*.
This is placed in the voucher-challenge-nonce field.

(XXX-should be done with JOSE? Probably)

NOTE: DPP has a round with the SHA256 of the device's key to make sure that
the correct device has been chosen.  The TLS connection effectively provides
the same privacy that the Bx keys provided.

The resulting object is POST'ed to the new BRSKI endpoint:

    /.well-known/est/requestvoucherrequest

[or should it be named:
    /.well-known/est/requestvoucherchallenge

]

## AR processing of voucher-request, request.

The AR processes this POST.  First it uses the private key that is associated
with it's QR printed public key to decrypt the voucher-request challenge.
Included in this challenge is a nonce, and also the link-local address of the
smartphone.

The AR SHOULD verify that the link-local address matches the originating
address of the connection on which the request is received.

The AR then forms a voucher-request identically to as described in section
5.2 of {{I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra}}.  Note that the AR uses it's
IDevID to sign the voucher-request.  This is the same key used to terminate
the TLS connection.

Note: It MUST be different from the public key printed in the QR code.

In addition to the randomly generated nonce that the AR generates to place
in the the voucher-request, into the nonce field,  it also includes the
_SPnonce_ in a new *voucher-challenge-nonce* field. {EDNOTE: hash of nonce?}

This voucher-request is then *returned* during the POST operation to the
smartphone.  (This is in constrast that in ANIMA the voucher-request is
sent by the device to the Registrar, or the MASA)

### Additions to Voucher-Request

QUESTION: should the *voucher-challenge-nonce* be provided directly in the
voucher-request, or should only a hash of the nonce be used?  The nonce is
otherwise not disclosed, and a MITM on the initial TLS connection would
get to see the nonce.  A hash of the nonce validates the nonce as easily.

## Smartphone validates connection

The smartphone then examines the resulting voucher-request. The smartphone
validates that the voucher-request is signed by the same public key as was
seen in the TLS ServerCertificate.

The smartphone then examines the contents of the voucher-request, and looks
for the *voucher-challenge-nonce*.  As this nonce was encrypted to the
AR, the only way that the resulting nonce could be correct is if the correct
private key was present on the AR to decrypt it.  Succesful verification of
the *voucher-challenge-nonce* (or the hash of it, see below) results in the
smartphone moving it's end of the connection from provisional to validated.

## Smart-Phone connects to MASA

The smarkaklink application running on the smartphone then examines the MASA
URL provided in the TLS ServerCertificate of the AR.  The smarkaklink
application then connects to that URL using it's 3G/LTE connection, taking on
the temporary role of Registrar.

A wrapped voucher-request is formed by the smartphone in the same
way as described in section 5.4 of {{I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra}}.
The prior-signed-voucher-request is filled in with the voucher-request
that was created by the AR in the previous step.

The proximity-registrar-cert of the wrapped voucher-request is set to be the
SelfDevID certificate of the smartphone.  The voucher-request is to be signed
by the SelfDevID.

The voucher-request is POST'ed to the MASA using the same URL that is used
for Registrar/MASA operation:

    /.well-known/est/requestvoucher


## MASA processing

The MASA processing occurs as specified in section 5.5 of
{{I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra}} as before.  The MASA MUST
also copy the *voucher-challenge-nonce* into the resulting voucher.

## Smartpledge processing of voucher

The smartphone will receive a voucher that contains it's IDevID as the
*pinned-domain-cert*, and the *voucher-challenge-nonce* that it created will also
be present.   The smartphone SHOULD verify the signature on the artifact,
but may be unable to validate that the certificate used has a relationship to
the TLS ServerCertificate used by the MASA. (This limitation exists in ANIMA
as well).

The smartphone will then POST the resulting voucher to the AR using the URL

    /.well-known/est/voucher

If an existing TLS connection is still available, it MAY be reused.

If a TLS session-resumption ticket (see {{RFC8446}} section 2.2 for TLS 1.3,
and {{RFC5077}} for TLS 1.2) has been obtained, it SHOULD be used if the
TLS connection needs to be rebuilt.  This is particularly useful in the
disconnected use case explained in {{disconnected}}.

## Adolescent Registrar (AR) receives voucher

When the AR receives the voucher, it validates that it is signed by it's
manufacturer.  This process is the same as section 5.5.1 of
{{I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra}}.

Again note that the AR is acting in the role of a pledge.

Inside the voucher, the pinned-domain-cert is examined. It should match the
TLS ClientCertificate that the smartphone used to connect.  This is the
SelfDevID.

At this point the AR has validated the identity of the smartphone, and the
AR moves it's end of the connection from provisional to validated.

## Adolescent Registrar (AR) grows up

The roles are now changed.

If necessary, the AR generates a new key pair as it's Domain CA key.  It MAY
generate intermediate CA certificates and a seperate Registrar certificate,
but this is discouraged for home network use.

The AR is now considered a full registrar.  The AR now takes on the role
of Registrar.

## Enrollment status

The AR responds to the POST of the voucher with the enrollment status as the
reply to the POST, as per the enrollment status object defined in BRSKI
section 5.9.4.

The smartphone MAY POST the resulting enrollment status to the MASA,
in a manner similar to BRSKI section 5.9.4. Note that the operation described
in that section is about telemetry from the pledge to the Registrar.
That telemetry was return as part of the POST above.

Returning enrollment status to the MASA is an optional action; while there are
privacy implications of doing so, the logicstics feedback of a failure likely
will result in a service technician visit, which is hardly privacy enhancing.
This telemetry return is strongly encouraged.

The POST to /.well-known/est/enrollstatus MUST include some additional
information to tell the MASA which device was involved.  This section
therefore defines a new element for the status return to be the "voucher"
attribute; it is to be filled in with the base64 encoding of the voucher that
was provided.  While this is excessive, it discloses no information that the
MASA does not already have, has been signed and identifies both the
Adolescent Router and the Smart Phone client involved.

## Smartphone enrolls

At this stage of the smarkaklink protocol, the typical BRSKI exchange is
over.  A Secure Transport has been established between the smartphone
and the fully-grown AR.  The smartphone now takes on the role of
secured pledge,  or EST client.

The smartphone MUST now request the full list of CA Certificates, as
per {{RFC7030}} section 4.1.  As the Registrar's CA certificate has just been
generated, the smartphone has no other way of knowing it.

The smartphone MUST now also generate a CSR request as per
{{I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra}} section 5.8.3.
The smartpledge MAY reuse the SelfDevID key pair for this purpose.
(XXX - maybe there are good reasons not to reuse?)

The Registrar SHOULD grant administrator privileges to the smartphone via
the certificate that is issued.  This may be done via special attributes in
the issued certificate, or it may pin the certificate in a database.
Which method to use is a local matter.

The TLS/EST connection MUST remain open at this point. This is connection one.

## Validation of connection

The smartphone MUST now open a new HTTPS connection to the Registrar (AR),
using it's newly issued certificate. (XXX should this be on a different IP, or a
different port?  If so, how is this indicated?)

The smartphone MUST validate that the new connection's TLS Server
certificate can be validated by the Registrar's new CA certificate.

The registrar MUST validate that the smartphone's ClientCertificate is
validated by the Registrar's CA.  The smartphone SHOULD perform a POST
operation on this new connection to the
{{I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra}} Enrollment Status Telemetry
mechanism, see section 5.8.3.

Upon success, the original TLS/EST connection (one) MAY now be closed.

# Protocol Details

## Quick Response Code (QR code) {#qrextra}

Section 5.3 of {{dpp}} describes the contents for an {{iso18004}} image.
It specifies content that starts with DPP:, and the contains a series of
semi-colon (;) deliminated section with a single letter and colon. This
markup is terminated with a double semi-colon.

Although no amending formula is defined in DPP 1.0, this document is defining
two extensions.  This requires amending the ABNF from section 5.2.1 as
follows:

    dpp-qr = “DPP:” [channel-list “;”] [channel-list “;”]
             [mac “;”] [information “;”] public-key
             [";" llv6-addr ] [";" mudurl ]
             [";" smarkaklink ] [";" essid ] “;;”
    llv6-addr = "L:" 8*hex-octet
    essid     = "E:" *(%x20-3A / %x3C-7E) ;   semicolon not allowed
    smarkaklink = "S:" *(%x20-3A / %x3C-7E) ; semicolon not allowed
    mudurl      = "D:" *(%x20-3A / %x3C-7E) ; semicolon not allowed

While the ABNF defined in the {{dpp}} document assumes a specific order
(C:, M:, I:, K:), this specification relaxes this so that the tags can come
in any order.   However, in order to make interoperation with future DPP-only
clients as seamless as possible, the extensions suggested here are placed at
the end of the list.  This is consistent with the Postel Principle.

It is intended that parts of this protocol could be performed by
an actual DPP implementation, should it become possible to implement DPP
using current smartphone operating systems in an unprivileged way.

### The Smarkaklink Attribute

The *smarkaklink* attribute indicates that the device is capable of the
protocol specified in this document.  The contents of the smarkaklink
attribute contains part or all of an IRI which identifies the
manufacturer of the device.

It SHOULD contain the _iauthority_ of an IRI as specified in section 2.2 of
{{RFC3987}}. The scheme is implicitely "https://", with an ipath of
"/.well-known/est/smarkaklink".  This implicit form exists to save bytes in
the QR code.

If the string contains any "/" characters, then it is not an _iauthority_,
but an entire IRI.  This takes many more characters, but is useful in a
variety of debugging situations, and also provides for new innovations.

Short URLs are important to fit into typical QR code space.

### Link-Layer Address Attribute

The *llv6-addr* attribute is optional.  When present, it specifies the IPv6
Link-Local address at which the adolescent router is listening.  If not
specified, then the link-local address may be formed according to the
historical (privacy-violating) process described in {{RFC4291}} Appendix A.
The *llv6-addr* attribute is present so that devices that have
implemented {{RFC7217}} stable addresses can express that address clearly.

### ESSID Name Attribute

The *essid* attribute provides the name of the 802.11 network on
which the enrollment will occur.  If this attribute is
absent, then it defaults to "BRSKI".

## Enrollment using EST

TBD

# Smart Pledge enrollment with manufacturer {#smartpledgeenroll}

While it is assumed that there will be many makers of Smarkaklink
applications, a goal of this specification is to eliminate the need for an
"app" per device, providing onboarding mechanism for a variety of devices
from a single app.

Given the secondary goal of a transition to use of Device Provisioning
Protocol (DPP), the smarkaklink application may have to be provided as part
of the smart phone system, as a system service. This is due to the need to
send/receive wifi management frames from DPP.  As such each vendor of
a smart device will need to produce a smarkaklink app, and it will be
impossible for the vendor of the Registrar device (or other DPP capable IoT
device) to provide an app on their own.

Having stated this goal, it is understood that initially the app may well
come from the manufacturer of the Registrar, but this protocol is designed on
the assumption that there is no such vertical integration.

So, there can be no initial relationship between the Smart Pledge and the
manufacturer of the Registrar.

But, in a traditional {{I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra}} scenario the
pledge would have been provided with an IDevID at manufacturing time.  While
an IDevID could have been built-in to the SmartPledge "app", such a key would
not be private if it was built-in.  A key could be generated by the app upon
installation.   It could be self-signed, it could be signed by the maker
of the app, or it could be signed by another party.

* a self-signed certificate is just a container for a public key.  For the
  purposes of the trust relationship with the Registrar, it would be
  sufficient.

* a certificate signed by the maker of the app (or the maker of the
  smart-phone) would carry no specific trust beyond what a self-signed
  certificate would have.  Any linking in the certificate to a network
  expressable identity (such as layer-2 address) would simply be a privacy
  violation.

* a certificate signed by another party would similarly have little
  additional relevance, unless the third party is the manufacturer of the
  Registrar!

The smarkaklink enrollment process uses a combination of the first and third
choice.  The involvement of the manufacturer at this step affords an
opporuntity to do sales-channel integration with the manufacturer.  The
manufacturer can associate an account with the user using a wide variety of
OAUTH2 {{RFC6749}} processes.  In addition, based upon the URL provided the
manufacturer can do redirection
along a value-added reseller process.   For instance, the manufacturer of a
home router could redirect the pledge to the ISP that resold the router.

While {{RFC7030}} describes a Certificate Signing Request in order to have
a certificate assigned, the actual contents of the certificate are not
interesting at all, and the process of attempting to come up with a
meaningful contents tends to cause more interoperability issues than having
nothing.

The Smarkaklink takes the *smartpledge attribute* from the QR code, forming a
URL as describe above.  An HTTPS POST is performed to this URL, with the JSON
body of:

    {
       "mac" : <mac-address>
    }

The HTTPS POST MUST be performed with freshly created self-signed
certificate.  If the smarkaklink application has previously communicated with
this URL, it MAY skip this step and use a previously returned certificate.
Doing so has a privacy implication discussed below, but is appropriate when
enrolling many devices from the same manufacturer into the same network.

The smarkaklink client should be prepared for three cases:

* A certificate is immediately returned.
* A 201 status code is returned, and Location: header is provided. A GET
  request to that location will retrieve the certificate.
* A 302 redirection occurs with some initiation of an OAUTH2 process to
  establish some additional authorization.
* Any other error (4xx and 5xx) are typically unrecoverable errors.

In the third case, the 302 response SHOULD take the smarkaklink operator to
the given URL in an interactive browser.  The operator SHOULD be given access
to their normal set of cookies and third-party logins such that they can use
appropriate third party (Google, Facebook, Github, Live.com, etc.) logins to
help validate the operator as a real person, and not a malware.
Such logins are optional, and it is a manufacturer choice as to what
integrations they want to make.

After the OAUTH2 process, the SmartPledge will be redirected back to the MASA
and a 201 status code will be returned when successful as above.

## minimal Smart Pledge enrollment

A manufacturer who has not built-in any restrictions on the identity that the
smarkaklink uses, MAY return the same self-signed certificate that the
smartpledge used to connect with.

# Threat Analysis

The following attacks have been considered.

## Wrong Administrator

Neighbours with similar setups wind up managing each other's network (by
mistake).

## Rogue Administrator

Uninitialized networks can be adopted by 'wardrivers' who search for networks
that have no administrator.

## Attack from Internal device

A compromised device inside the home can be used by an attack to take control
of the home router.

## Attack from camera enabled robot

A robot (such as a home vacuum cleaner) could be compromised, and then used
by an attacker to observe and/or scan the router QRcode.

## Attack from manipulator enabled robot

A robot (for instance, a toy) could be compromised, and then used
by an attacker to push the WPA and/or factory reset button on the router.
